    "### The A/B Testing Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following stylized scenario. The manager of a webshop performs an A/B test to estimate the effect a new ad design $A$ has on customers' purchases (in $100\\$$), $Y$, on average. This effect is called the **A**verage **T**reatment **E**ffect (**ATE**). The treatment is assigned randomly conditional on the visitors' characteristics, which we call $V$. Such characteristics could be collected from a customer's shoppers account, for example. These might include the number of previous purchases, time since the last purchase, length of stay on a page as well as whether a customer has a rewards card, among other characteristics. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we use a **D**irected **A**cyclical **G**raph (DAG) to illustrate our assumptions on the causal structure of the scenario. As not only the outcome, but also the treatment is dependent on the individual characteristics, there are arrows going from $V$ to both $A$ and $Y$. In our example, we also assume that the treatment $A$ is a direct cause of the customers' purchases $Y$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why control for individual characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start the case study, let us briefly address the question why we need to include individual characteristics in our analysis at all. There are mainly two reasons why we want to control for observable characteristics. First, so-called confounders, i.e., variables that have a causal effect on both the treatment variable and the outcome variable, possibly create a bias in our estimate. In order to uncover the true causal effect of the treatment, it is necessary that our causal framework takes all confounding variables into account. Otherwise, the average causal effect of the treatment on the outcome is not identified. A second reason to include individual characteristics is efficiency. The more variation can be explained within our causal framework, the more precise will be the resulting estimate. In practical terms, greater efficiency leads to tighter confidence intervals and smaller standard errors and p-values. This might help to improve the power of A/B tests even if the treatment variable is unconditionally assigned to individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use machine learning to analyze A/B tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "ML methods have turned out to be very flexible in terms of modeling complex relationships of explanatory variables and dependent variables and, thus, have exhibited a great predictive performance in many applications. In the double machine learning approach ([Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060)), ML methods are used for modelling so-called nuisance functions. In terms of the A/B case study considered here, ML tools can be used to flexibly control for confounding variables. For example, a linear parametric specification as in a standard linear regression model might not be correct and, hence, not sufficient to account for the underlying confounding. Moreover, by using powerful ML techniques, the causal model will likely be able to explain a greater share of the total variation and, hence, lead to more precise estimation."

In this challenge, a great number of data sets have been generated in a way that they mimic distributional relationships that are found in many economic real data applications. Although the data have not been generated explicitly to address an A/B testing case study, they are well-suited for demonstration purposes. We will focus on one of the many different data genereting processes (DGP) that we picked at random, in this particualar case a data set called `high42`. An advantage of using the synthetic [ACIC 2019 data](https://sites.google.com/view/acic2019datachallenge/data-challenge) is that we know the true average treatment effect which is 0.8 in our data set.\n"
