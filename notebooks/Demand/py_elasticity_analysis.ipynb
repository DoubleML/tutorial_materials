    "In this example, we will demonstrate the use of the [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html) package in a real-data industry example: Estimation of price elasticity of demand. This notebook is based on a [blogpost by Lars Roemheld (Roemheld, 2021)](https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-example-elasticity-de4a3e2e621b) with code and preprocessed data being available from [GitHub](https://github.com/larsroemheld/causalinf_ex_elasticity). The original data file is made available as a public domain (CC0 1.0 Universal) data set and shared on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vijayuv/onlineretail). It contains data on sales from an online retailer in the period of December 2010 until December 2011.\n",

    "\"Supply\" and \"demand\" are probably the very first terms that economics and business students hear in their studies. In industry, the price elasticity of demand is a very important quantity: It indicates how much the demand for a product (= the quantity sold by the firm) changes due to a change in its price. As a retailer, this quantity is of great interest because it makes it possible to increase revenues, and eventually profits, by optimally adjusting prices according to elasticities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price elasticity of demand is formally defined as the relative change of the demanded quantity ($q$) of a product given a percent-change of the price ($p$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\partial q/q}{\\partial p/p}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the parameter $\\theta_0$ can be interpreted as follows: Provided the price for a product increases by $1\\%$, the demanded quantity changes by $\\theta_0\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it would be possible to estimate $\\theta_0$ based on an experiment or A/B test. However, this is not possible in our case as the data set only contains information on actual purchases in the period of consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal problem of price estimation based on an observational study is quite complex: It involves many (simultaneous) decisions made by the customers and the sellers. One approach for estimation of the causal parameter $\\theta_0$ would be to account for confounding variables, that might have an effect to both the price and the quantity sold. The approach taken in  [Roemheld (2021)](https://towardsdatascience.com/causal-inference-example-elasticity-de4a3e2e621b) is to flexibly account for and construct confounding variables, for example including similarities in their product description or seasonal patterns, and thereby justifying identification of $\\theta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a [partially linear regression](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/guide/models.html#partially-linear-regression-model-plr) (PLR) model for estimation of $\\theta_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log Q = \\theta_0 \\log P + g_0(X) + \\zeta,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\mathbb{E}(\\zeta|D,X)=0$. The confounders can enter the regression equation nonlinearily via the function $g_0(X)$. In order to equip $\\theta_0$ (approximately) with the interpretation of a price elasticity, we applied the $\\log()$ to both the demanded quantity ($Q$) and the prices ($P$), i.e., we set up a $\\log$-$\\log$-regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed with the data analysis, it is important to mention a potential drawback to our analysis: The data only contains information on sales, not on stock days. Hence, based on this data set, it is not possible to assess what happened on days without sales (sales = 0). This drawback must be kept in mind when we draw causal conclusions from this analysis."
